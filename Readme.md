1. API endpoint to create a text file in a particular folder - used post method and writeFileSync 
2. Content of the file will be the current timestamp
3. API endpoint to retrieve the text file in a particular folder - used get method and readFileSync


1. Used express and node js file system
2. I have created file name with only date string along with random text to differentiate the file names
3. And current date & time file name is creating an issue so i have created with only date string.
