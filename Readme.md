1. API endpoint to create a text file in a particular folder - used writeFileSync
2. Content of the file will be the current timestamp
3. API endpoint to retrieve the text file in a particular folder - used readFileSync

Note: Folder creation is not working correct for me, so i have created a file with only date string.
